# Multi_Protocol_Gateway
Graduation project: a secure multi-protocol IoT gateway for real-world applications in water quality monitoring systems


Developed a secure multi-protocol IoT gateway for real-world applications in water quality monitoring systems. The gateway enables seamless communication between isolated IoT systems by supporting multiple wireless protocols across various frequency bands. This solution allows devices that typically can't communicate to work together effectively. The project utilized a Raspberry Pi for central processing and a Texas Instruments microcontroller for protocol handling and communication.
